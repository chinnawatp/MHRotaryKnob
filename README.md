# MHRotaryKnob

This is a `UIControl` that acts like a rotary knob. In operation it is similar to a `UISlider` but its shape is square rather than long and narrow.

## How to use

Copy **MHRotaryKnob.h** and **MHRotaryKnob.m** into your project. Add **QuartzCore** to your target's frameworks.

You have to provide the images for the knob and the background. The demo project includes a few basic images but you probably want to use graphics that suit your app's look-and-feel better. 

If you want to do more fancy drawing, then you can easily modify the class. Its `-valueDidChangeFrom:to:animated:` method is invoked whenever the value changes. In the default implementation it simply rotates the knob image. You can change or override this method to do custom drawing.
